		People often shy away from meditation because they feel they have to remain completely undistracted for long periods of time, when that's not in fact, the case. 
	</p>
	<p class="introPara">
		A meditation practice can last an hour but it can be as short as three minutes for each session, and you'll still reap the benefits. And while it's recommended, you also don't have to have your eyes closed.

	<h2>Here are three types of meditation practices to enjoy.</h2>

				<h3>In Mindfulness Meditation, there is a focus on the present moment. Any thoughts that may come up, you are encouraged to acknowlege them but not allow yourself to get caught up in the feelings that may arise. It's about observing those thoughts and understanding them as if you were a third party, no judgement, just acceptance and when you can, let them pass. Just breathe.</h3>

				<h3>A fan favorite, the Body Scan meditation is exactly what it means: You focus on how your body feels part by part, from head to toe. It's a wonderful exercise that increases concentration and promotes relaxation as you take notice of any physical tensions that exist, and you relax the muscles.</h3>

				<h3>The Walking Meditation is a wonderful way of meditating if you feel the need to move. You're bringing attention to how you walk; think of it as a body scan but in reverse. You're also allowing yourself to become aware of sights, sounds, smells as well as how elements in the environmental affect you physically, e.g. the warmth of the sun on your face or the light breeze on your arm.</h3>
